# FF_Hackathon
Future Factory Hackathon (2022.12.16)

## Goal

To fill in DNA of houses via analysis of images and polygons

## Group 3 
Sub-group 1: top-view image + geojson + label: Polygon →  elevation map

Sub-group 2: Polygon → classification of dormer types and roof types

Sub-group 3: top-view image → classification of dormer types and roof types in top-view images via CNN

## Authorship

The task of all the sub-groups were discussed and decided in the main group.  Group 3 is a group of 6 students from 3 universities and 5 countries. 

The code in this Jupyter Notebook and the .csv file are an extraction of work that Sub-group 3 (3 students, coming from 2 universities and 3 countries) achieved in 5 hours. Within the limited time, we only completed data preprocessing, and determined that the data that are acutally valid are too impbalanced for building a good CNN.

In Sub-group3, I contributed in problem analysis, formulation of the algorithm, majority of coding and judgement of the results, another teammate contributed in part of the syntaxes, and the remaining one observed and helped checking the results.  

Unfortunately I do not have everyone's contact to seek their consents for revealing their names and sharing our slide presentation here. As such, personal privacy is prioritized above authorship.
